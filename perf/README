THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL CODE
-------------------------

This folder contains a general async store test and performance measurement tool. It
uses the jcntl interface to enqueue and dequeue messages as fast as possible from
a number of persistent store instances.

The parameters fall into two groups:

1. Test parameters:

-m --num_msgs:              Number of messages to send
-S --msg_size:              Size of each message to be sent
-q --num_queues:            Number of simultaneous queues
-t --num_threads_per_queue: Number of threads per queue

2. Store parameters, which control the attributes of the store itself:

-d --jrnl_dir:              Store directory
-b --jrnl_base_filename:    Base name for journal files
-f --num_jfiles:            Number of journal files
-s --jfsize_sblks:          Size of each journal file in sblks (512 byte blocks)
-a --auto_expand:           Auto-expand the journal
-e --ae_max_jfiles:         Upper limit on number of auto-expanded journal files
-p --wcache_num_pages:      Number of write buffer pages
-c --wcache_pgsize_sblks:   Size of each write buffer page in sblks (512 byte blocks)

For each test:

a. The correct number of store instances are created with their formatted store files;
b. The timer begins;
c. The specified number of threads are created and do the work of enqueueing and
   dequeueing persistent messages on the specified number of store instances;
d. When all threads have finished working, the timer is stopped;
e. The results of the test are printed.
