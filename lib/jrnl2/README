This directory contains experimental code. It is not (currently)
a part of the main store, and can be safely ignored for all
normal builds.

This is a refactorization of the lib/jrnl directory, with completely
renamed classes according to normal C++ naming standards used elsewhere
in this project.

Also included are the following enhancements:
* A new record type for journal events. This will allow the redelivered
  flag to be set correctly (amongst other things)
* A new record tail layout which contains a checksum. This will solve the
  issue of losing data unknowingly if the first and last pages of a
  multi-page write occur, but some in-between pages are still pending at
  time of failure.
* Some minor refactoring of the FileHeader type
* A clean-up with a proper heirarchy of these classes

NOTE: these will break binary compatibility with earlier journals - an
upgrade issue. This journal will need to have its revision number incremented
from 1 to 2.
